## Overview

`twoCoprimary` provides comprehensive tools for sample size and power
calculation in clinical trials with two co-primary endpoints. In
co-primary endpoint trials, treatment success requires demonstrating
statistically significant effects on **all** primary endpoints
simultaneously. This package implements state-of-the-art methodologies
that properly account for correlation between endpoints, leading to more
efficient trial designs.

📖 **[Documentation
Website](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/twoCoprimary/)**

## Key Features

The package supports five combinations of co-primary endpoints:

- **Two continuous endpoints** - Normal distribution with correlation
  (Sozu et al., 2011)
- **Two binary endpoints (asymptotic)** - Large sample approximation
  methods (Sozu et al., 2010)
- **Two binary endpoints (exact)** - Exact inference for small to medium
  samples (Homma & Yoshida, 2025)
- **Mixed continuous and binary** - Biserial correlation structure (Sozu
  et al., 2012)
- **Mixed count and continuous** - Negative binomial for overdispersed
  counts (Homma & Yoshida, 2024)

All methods provide: - ✅ Sample size calculation given target power -
✅ Power calculation given sample size - ✅ Proper Type I error control
without multiplicity adjustment - ✅ Accounting for correlation between
endpoints - ✅ Support for unbalanced allocation ratios

## Installation

Install from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("twoCoprimary")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("gosukehommaEX/twoCoprimary")
```

## Quick Start

### Example 1: Two Continuous Endpoints

Calculate sample size for a trial with two continuous co-primary
endpoints:

``` r
library(twoCoprimary)

# Sample size calculation
result <- ss2Continuous(
  delta1 = 0.5,      # Standardized effect size for endpoint 1
  delta2 = 0.4,      # Standardized effect size for endpoint 2
  rho = 0.3,         # Correlation between endpoints
  alpha = 0.025,     # One-sided significance level
  power = 0.80,      # Target power
  r = 1              # Allocation ratio (1:1)
)

print(result)
#> 
#> Sample size calculation for two continuous co-primary endpoints
#> 
#> Parameters:
#>   Effect sizes: delta1 = 0.5, delta2 = 0.4
#>   Correlation: rho = 0.3
#>   Significance level: alpha = 0.025 (one-sided)
#>   Target power: 1 - beta = 0.8
#>   Allocation ratio: r = 1
#> 
#> Results:
#>   Sample size per group: n1 = n2 = 130
#>   Total sample size: N = 260
```

### Example 2: Two Binary Endpoints (Exact Method)

For small to medium sample sizes, use exact methods:

``` r
# Sample size with exact inference
result_exact <- ss2BinaryExact(
  p11 = 0.30, p12 = 0.15,    # Response rates for endpoint 1
  p21 = 0.50, p22 = 0.30,    # Response rates for endpoint 2
  rho1 = 0.3, rho2 = 0.3,    # Within-group correlations
  alpha = 0.025,             # One-sided significance level
  power = 0.80,              # Target power
  r = 1,                     # Allocation ratio
  test_method = "Fisher"     # Exact test method
)

print(result_exact)
```

### Example 3: Mixed Count and Continuous Endpoints

For COPD/asthma trials with exacerbation count and lung function:

``` r
# Exacerbation rates (events per year)
r1 <- 0.80  # Treatment group
r2 <- 1.25  # Control group

# Sample size calculation
result_mixed <- ss2MixedCountContinuous(
  r1 = r1, r2 = r2,          # Event rates
  nu = 1.0,                  # Dispersion parameter
  t = 1,                     # Follow-up period (years)
  mu1 = 250, mu2 = 200,      # Mean FEV1 (mL)
  sd = 300,                  # Common SD
  rho1 = 0.5, rho2 = 0.5,    # Correlations
  alpha = 0.025,
  power = 0.80,
  r = 1
)

print(result_mixed)
```
