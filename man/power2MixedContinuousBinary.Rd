\description{
Calculates the power for a two-arm superiority trial with two co-primary
endpoints where one is continuous and one is binary, as described in
Sozu et al. (2012). This function is specifically designed for mixed
continuous-binary endpoint combinations.
}
\details{
This function implements the power calculation for mixed continuous-binary endpoints
as described in Sozu et al. (2012). The method assumes that the binary variable is
derived from a latent continuous variable via dichotomization at a threshold point.

\strong{Endpoint Types:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Continuous Endpoint}: Analyzed using t-test for comparing means
\item \strong{Binary Endpoint}: Analyzed using one of several methods (AN, ANc, AS, ASc, or Fisher)
}

\strong{Biserial Correlation Model:}
The binary endpoint is assumed to arise from dichotomizing a latent continuous
variable at a threshold. The correlation parameter ρ (rho) represents the biserial
correlation between the observed continuous endpoint and this latent continuous
variable underlying the binary endpoint.

\strong{Key Model Assumptions:}
\itemize{
\item The latent variable underlying the binary endpoint follows a bivariate normal
distribution with the continuous endpoint
\item For group i with response probability πᵢ, the latent variable has mean μᵢ = Φ⁻¹(πᵢ)
and variance 1
\item The dichotomization threshold is set at 0, so P(X ≥ 0) = Φ(μᵢ) = πᵢ
\item This is equivalent to using varying cutoff points with fixed means, and is the
standard approach in biserial correlation models
}

\strong{Note on Table 2 in Supporting Information:}
There is a typographical error in the original paper's Table 2 for Arcsine(CC)
method. The second term in the numerator should use πCk'θCk' instead of πTk'θTk'.
This implementation uses the corrected formula.

\strong{Understanding Key Quantities:}
\itemize{
\item ρ (rho): Biserial correlation between the continuous endpoint and the latent
continuous variable underlying the binary endpoint (before dichotomization)
\item γ (gamma): Correlation between the test statistics of the two endpoints
(after dichotomization and standardization)
\item ξ: Standard normal density at the dichotomization threshold, calculated as
ξ = φ(Φ⁻¹(1-π)) where π is the response probability
\item c\emph{₁/c}₂: Ratio of standardized critical values for the two endpoints. When
c\emph{₁/c}₂ ≈ 1, the individual powers of the two endpoints are approximately equal
