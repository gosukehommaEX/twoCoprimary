\item{p11}{True probability of responders in group 1 for the first outcome (0 < p11 < 1)}

\item{p12}{True probability of responders in group 1 for the second outcome (0 < p12 < 1)}

\item{p21}{True probability of responders in group 2 for the first outcome (0 < p21 < 1)}

\item{p22}{True probability of responders in group 2 for the second outcome (0 < p22 < 1)}

\item{rho1}{Correlation between the two outcomes for group 1}

\item{rho2}{Correlation between the two outcomes for group 2}

\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level (typically 0.025 or 0.05)}

\item{Test}{Statistical testing method. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"AN"}: Asymptotic normal method without continuity correction
\item \code{"ANc"}: Asymptotic normal method with continuity correction
\item \code{"AS"}: Arcsine method without continuity correction
\item \code{"ASc"}: Arcsine method with continuity correction
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\item{n1}{Sample size for group 1}
\item{n2}{Sample size for group 2}
\item{p11, p12, p21, p22}{Response probabilities}
\item{rho1, rho2}{Correlations}
\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level}
\item{Test}{Testing method used}
\item{power1}{Power for the first endpoint alone}
\item{power2}{Power for the second endpoint alone}
\item{powerCoprimary}{Power for both co-primary endpoints}
}
\description{
Calculates the power for a two-arm superiority trial with two co-primary
binary endpoints using approximate methods, as described in Sozu et al. (2010).
}
\details{
This function calculates the power using asymptotic normal approximation or
arcsine transformation methods as described in Sozu et al. (2010).

The power for co-primary endpoints is calculated using the bivariate normal
distribution, accounting for the correlation between endpoints.
