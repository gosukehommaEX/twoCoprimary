\title{Calculate Correlation Bounds Between Count and Continuous Outcomes}
\usage{
corrbound2MixedContinuousCount(lambda, nu, mu, sd, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{Expected number of events for the count outcome (lambda = rate * time)}

\item{nu}{Dispersion parameter for the negative binomial distribution (nu > 0)}

\item{mu}{Mean of the continuous outcome}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation of the continuous outcome}

\item{t}{Follow-up time period}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with two elements:
\item{L_bound}{Lower bound of the correlation}
\item{U_bound}{Upper bound of the correlation}
}
\description{
Computes the lower and upper bounds of the correlation coefficient between
an overdispersed count outcome (negative binomial) and a continuous outcome
using Frechet-Hoeffding bounds, as described in Homma and Yoshida (2024).
}
\details{
For a count outcome Y1 ~ NB(lambda, nu) and a continuous outcome Y2 ~ N(mu, sd^2),
the correlation coefficient rho is bounded by Frechet-Hoeffding bounds:
\deqn{L(\rho) = \frac{\int [H^-(F_1(y_1), F_2(y_2)) - F_1(y_1)F_2(y_2)] dy_2}
      {\sd_{Y_1} \times \sd_{Y_2}}}
\deqn{U(\rho) = \frac{\int [H^+(F_1(y_1), F_2(y_2)) - F_1(y_1)F_2(y_2)] dy_2}
      {\sd_{Y_1} \times \sd_{Y_2}}}
where H^- and H^+ are the lower and upper Frechet-Hoeffding bounds, respectively.

The variance of the negative binomial distribution is: Var(Y1) = lambda + lambda^2/nu

\examples{
# Calculate correlation bounds for NB(1.25, 0.8) and N(0, 250)
corrbound2MixedContinuousCount(lambda = 1.25, nu = 0.8, mu = 0, sd = 250, t = 1)

# Higher dispersion parameter
corrbound2MixedContinuousCount(lambda = 2.0, nu = 2.0, mu = 50, sd = 200, t = 1)

# Different follow-up time
corrbound2MixedContinuousCount(lambda = 1.0 * 2, nu = 1.0, mu = 0, sd = 300, t = 2)
