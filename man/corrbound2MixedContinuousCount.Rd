\title{Calculate Correlation Bounds for Mixed Count and Continuous Outcomes}
\usage{
corrbound2MixedContinuousCount(lambda, nu, mu, sd, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{Expected number of events (lambda = r * t, where r is the rate
and t is the follow-up time)}

\item{nu}{Dispersion parameter for the negative binomial distribution (nu > 0)}

\item{mu}{Mean of the continuous outcome}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation of the continuous outcome}

\item{t}{Follow-up time period}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with two elements:
\item{L_bound}{Lower bound of the correlation}
\item{U_bound}{Upper bound of the correlation}
}
\description{
Computes the lower and upper bounds of the correlation coefficient between
a negative binomial count outcome and a continuous outcome, using the
Frechet-Hoeffding bounds as described in Homma and Yoshida (2024).
}
\details{
For a negative binomial count outcome Y1 ~ NB(lambda, nu) and a continuous
outcome Y2 ~ N(mu, sd^2), the correlation coefficient rho is bounded using
the Frechet-Hoeffding bounds on copulas:

\strong{Lower bound (Frechet-Hoeffding lower bound):}
\deqn{H^-(u, v) = \max(u + v - 1, 0)}

\strong{Upper bound (Frechet-Hoeffding upper bound):}
\deqn{H^+(u, v) = \min(u, v)}

The variance of the negative binomial distribution is: Var(Y1) = lambda + lambda^2/nu
}
\examples{
# Calculate correlation bounds for NB(1.25, 0.8) and N(0, 250)
corrbound2MixedContinuousCount(lambda = 1.25, nu = 0.8, mu = 0, sd = 250, t = 1)

# Higher dispersion parameter
corrbound2MixedContinuousCount(lambda = 2.0, nu = 2.0, mu = 50, sd = 200, t = 1)

# Different follow-up time
corrbound2MixedContinuousCount(lambda = 1.0 * 2, nu = 1.0, mu = 0, sd = 300, t = 2)
