\title{Sample Size Calculation for a Single Continuous Endpoint}
\usage{
ss1Continuous(delta, sd, r, alpha, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{Mean difference between treatment groups (treatment effect)}

\item{sd}{Common standard deviation for the continuous endpoint}

\item{r}{Allocation ratio of group 1 to group 2 (group 1:group 2 = r:1, where r > 0)}

\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level (typically 0.025 or 0.05)}

\item{beta}{Target type II error rate (typically 0.1 or 0.2)}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\item{delta}{Mean difference (treatment effect)}
\item{sd}{Common standard deviation}
\item{r}{Allocation ratio}
\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level}
\item{beta}{Type II error rate}
\item{n1}{Required sample size for group 1}
\item{n2}{Required sample size for group 2}
\item{n}{Total sample size (n1 + n2)}
}
\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with a
single continuous endpoint using the standard formula for normally distributed
outcomes.
}
\details{
The required sample size for group 2 is calculated using the standard formula:
\deqn{n_2 = \left\lceil \frac{(1 + 1/r) \sigma^2 (z_\alpha + z_\beta)^2}{\delta^2} \right\rceil}
where \eqn{z_\alpha} and \eqn{z_\beta} are the quantiles of the standard normal
distribution corresponding to the one-sided significance level \eqn{\alpha} and
type II error rate \eqn{\beta}, respectively. The sample size for group 1 is
\eqn{n_1 = \lceil r \times n_2 \rceil}.

\examples{
# Balanced design with 1:1 allocation
ss1Continuous(delta = 0.4, sd = 1, r = 1, alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.1)

# Unbalanced design with 2:1 allocation
ss1Continuous(delta = 0.5, sd = 1.2, r = 2, alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.2)

# Large treatment effect
ss1Continuous(delta = 0.8, sd = 1, r = 1, alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.1)
