\title{Sample Size Calculation for a Single Continuous Endpoint}
\usage{
ss1Continuous(delta, sd, r, alpha, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{Mean difference (group 1 - group 2)}

\item{sd}{Common standard deviation}

\item{r}{Allocation ratio (group 1:group 2 = r:1, where r > 0)}

\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level (typically 0.025 or 0.05)}

\item{beta}{Target type II error rate (typically 0.1 or 0.2)}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\item{delta}{Mean difference}
\item{sd}{Standard deviation}
\item{r}{Allocation ratio}
\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level}
\item{beta}{Type II error rate}
\item{n1}{Required sample size for group 1}
\item{n2}{Required sample size for group 2}
\item{n}{Total sample size (n1 + n2)}
}
\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with a
single continuous endpoint.
}
\details{
The required sample size is calculated using the standard formula for
continuous endpoints:
\deqn{n_2 = \left\lceil \left(\frac{(z_{1-\alpha} + z_{1-\beta}) \sigma}{\delta}\right)^2
      \left(1 + \frac{1}{r}\right) \right\rceil}
where \eqn{z_{1-\alpha}} and \eqn{z_{1-\beta}} are standard normal quantiles.

\examples{
# Balanced design with 1:1 allocation
ss1Continuous(delta = 0.2, sd = 1, r = 1, alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.1)

# Unbalanced design with 2:1 allocation
ss1Continuous(delta = 0.3, sd = 1, r = 2, alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.2)

# Larger effect size
ss1Continuous(delta = 0.5, sd = 1, r = 1, alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.1)
