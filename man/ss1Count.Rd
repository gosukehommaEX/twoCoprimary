\title{Sample Size Calculation for a Single Count Endpoint (Negative Binomial)}
\usage{
ss1Count(r0, r1, nu, t, r, alpha, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{r0}{Mean rate (events per unit time) for the control group}

\item{r1}{Mean rate (events per unit time) for the treatment group}

\item{nu}{Common dispersion parameter for the negative binomial distribution (nu > 0)}

\item{t}{Common follow-up time period}

\item{r}{Allocation ratio (treatment:control = r:1, where r > 0)}

\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level (typically 0.025 or 0.05)}

\item{beta}{Target type II error rate (typically 0.1 or 0.2)}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\item{r0}{Mean rate for control group}
\item{r1}{Mean rate for treatment group}
\item{nu}{Dispersion parameter}
\item{t}{Follow-up time}
\item{r}{Allocation ratio}
\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level}
\item{beta}{Type II error rate}
\item{n0}{Required sample size for control group}
\item{n1}{Required sample size for treatment group}
\item{N}{Total sample size (n0 + n1)}
}
\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with a
single overdispersed count endpoint following a negative binomial distribution,
as described in Homma and Yoshida (2024).
}
\details{
The test statistic for the negative binomial rate ratio is:
\deqn{Z_1 = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{\sqrt{Var(\hat{\beta}_1)}}}
where \eqn{\hat{\beta}_1 = \log(\bar{Y}_1) - \log(\bar{Y}_0)} and the variance is:
\deqn{Var(\hat{\beta}_1) = \frac{1}{n_0}\left[\frac{1}{t}\left(\frac{1}{r_0} +
      \frac{1}{\r r_1}\right) + \frac{1+\r}{\nu\r}\right]}

This is equation (8) in Homma and Yoshida (2024).

\examples{
# Sample size for count endpoint with nu = 0.8
ss1Count(r0 = 1.25, r1 = 1.0, nu = 0.8, t = 1, r = 1,
         alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.1)

# Unbalanced design with 2:1 allocation
ss1Count(r0 = 1.5, r1 = 1.0, nu = 1.0, t = 1, r = 2,
         alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.2)

# Higher dispersion
ss1Count(r0 = 2.0, r1 = 1.5, nu = 3.0, t = 1, r = 1,
         alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.1)
