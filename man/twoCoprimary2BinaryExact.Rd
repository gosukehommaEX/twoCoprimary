\arguments{
\item{n1}{Sample size for group 1 (treatment group). If NULL, will be calculated.}

\item{n2}{Sample size for group 2 (control group). If NULL, will be calculated.}

\item{p11}{True response probability for endpoint 1 in group 1}

\item{p12}{True response probability for endpoint 2 in group 1}

\item{p21}{True response probability for endpoint 1 in group 2}

\item{p22}{True response probability for endpoint 2 in group 2}

\item{rho1}{Correlation between endpoints 1 and 2 in group 1}

\item{rho2}{Correlation between endpoints 1 and 2 in group 2}

\item{power}{Target power (1 - beta). If NULL, will be calculated.}

\item{r}{Allocation ratio (n1/n2). Required when calculating sample size.}

\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level (typically 0.025 or 0.05)}

\item{Test}{Test method: "Fisher" (Fisher's exact test), "Chisq"
(Chi-squared test), "Z-pooled" (Z-pooled exact unconditional test),
or "Boschloo" (Boschloo's exact unconditional test)}
}
\value{
An object of class "twoCoprimary" containing either:
\itemize{
\item Power calculation results (when n1 and n2 are specified)
\item Sample size calculation results (when power and r are specified)
}
}
\description{
This function provides a unified interface for both power calculation and
sample size determination for two co-primary binary endpoints using exact
inference methods.
}
\details{
This function serves as a unified interface similar to \code{power.prop.test()}.
The function determines the operation mode based on which parameters are NULL.

Exactly one of {(n1, n2), (power, r)} must be NULL.

Note: Exact methods are computationally intensive and may take considerable
time, especially for large sample sizes.
