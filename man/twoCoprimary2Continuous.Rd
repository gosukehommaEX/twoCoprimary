\arguments{
\item{n1}{Sample size for group 1 (treatment group). If NULL, will be calculated.}

\item{n2}{Sample size for group 2 (control group). If NULL, will be calculated.}

\item{delta1}{Mean difference for the first endpoint}

\item{delta2}{Mean difference for the second endpoint}

\item{sd1}{Common standard deviation for the first endpoint}

\item{sd2}{Common standard deviation for the second endpoint}

\item{rho}{Common correlation between the two outcomes}

\item{power}{Target power (1 - beta). If NULL, will be calculated.}

\item{r}{Allocation ratio (n1/n2). Required when calculating sample size.}

\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level (typically 0.025 or 0.05)}

\item{known_var}{Logical indicating whether variance is known (TRUE) or
unknown (FALSE). Default is TRUE.}

\item{nMC}{Number of Monte Carlo simulations when known_var = FALSE.
Default is 10000.}
}
\value{
An object of class "twoCoprimary" containing either:
\itemize{
\item Power calculation results (when n1 and n2 are specified)
\item Sample size calculation results (when power and r are specified)
}
}
\description{
This function provides a unified interface for both power calculation and
sample size determination for two co-primary continuous endpoints. Depending
on which parameters are provided (sample sizes or power), the function
automatically determines whether to calculate power or sample size.
}
\details{
This function serves as a unified interface similar to \code{power.prop.test()}.
The function determines the operation mode based on which parameters are NULL:
\itemize{
\item If n1 and n2 are provided and power is NULL: calculates power
\item If power and r are provided and n1/n2 are NULL: calculates sample size
}

Exactly one of {(n1, n2), (power, r)} must be NULL.
