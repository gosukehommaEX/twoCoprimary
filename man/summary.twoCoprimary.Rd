\title{Summary Method for twoCoprimary Objects}
\usage{
\method{summary}{twoCoprimary}(object, rho_values = c(0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8), digits = 2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class "twoCoprimary" from power or sample size
calculation functions}

\item{rho_values}{Numeric vector of correlation values to evaluate. Default
is c(0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8). For binary endpoints with two correlations (rho1
and rho2), both correlations are set to each value in rho_values.}

\item{digits}{Number of decimal places for rounding numeric values in the
output. Default is 2. Sample sizes are always rounded to integers.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A data.frame in wide format with:
\itemize{
\item First column: Parameter names
\item Subsequent columns: Values for each correlation specified in
rho_values
}
}
\description{
Creates a summary table showing how sample size or power varies across
different correlation values for two co-primary endpoints designs. The
output format is similar to tables in Sozu et al. (2011), with parameters
displayed vertically and correlation values displayed horizontally.
}
\details{
The function recalculates sample size or power across the specified range
of correlation values, holding all other parameters constant. This allows
comparison of how the correlation between endpoints affects design
characteristics.

For power calculation results (when n1 and n2 are specified), the function
calculates sample sizes needed to achieve the observed power at different
correlation values.

For sample size calculation results (when power is specified), the function
calculates the power achieved by the calculated sample size at different
correlation values.

The table format follows Sozu et al. (2011) with effect sizes and standard
deviations (or proportions, rates, and dispersions for binary/count
endpoints) shown for each group, followed by sample sizes and power values
for each correlation.
