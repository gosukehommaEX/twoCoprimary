\description{
Calculates the power for a two-arm superiority trial with two co-primary
continuous endpoints, as described in Sozu et al. (2011).
}
\details{
For known variance, the power is calculated using the bivariate normal distribution
as described in Sozu et al. (2011). The test statistics are:
\deqn{Z_k = \frac{\delta_k}{\sigma_k \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}}}
for k = 1, 2. The co-primary power is:
\deqn{1 - \beta = \Phi_2\left(-z_{1-\alpha} + Z_1, -z_{1-\alpha} + Z_2 \mid \rho\right)}
where \eqn{\Phi_2} is the cumulative distribution function of the bivariate
standard normal distribution.

For unknown variance, Monte Carlo simulation is used with Wishart-distributed
variance-covariance matrices to account for variance estimation uncertainty,
following equation (6) in Sozu et al. (2011):
\deqn{\text{Power} = E_W\left[\Phi_2(-c_1^*\sqrt{w_{11}}, -c_2^*\sqrt{w_{22}} | \rho)\right]}
where \eqn{c_k^* = t_{\alpha,\nu}\sqrt{\frac{1}{\nu}} - \frac{Z_k}{\sqrt{w_{kk}}}} and
\eqn{W} follows a Wishart distribution with \eqn{\nu = n_1 + n_2 - 2} degrees of freedom.
