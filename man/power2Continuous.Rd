\description{
Calculates the power for a two-arm superiority trial with two co-primary
continuous endpoints, as described in Sozu et al. (2011).
}
\details{
For known variance, the power is calculated using the bivariate normal distribution
as described in Sozu et al. (2011). The test statistics are:
\deqn{Z_k = \frac{\delta_k}{\sigma_k \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}}}
for k = 1, 2. The co-primary power is:
\deqn{1 - \beta = \Phi_2\left(-z_{1-\alpha} + Z_1, -z_{1-\alpha} + Z_2 \mid \rho\right)}
where \eqn{\Phi_2} is the cumulative distribution function of the bivariate
standard normal distribution.

For unknown variance, Monte Carlo simulation is used with Wishart-distributed
variance-covariance matrices to account for variance estimation uncertainty.
