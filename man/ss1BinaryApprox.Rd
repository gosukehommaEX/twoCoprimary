\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with a
single binary endpoint using various statistical testing methods.
}
\details{
This function implements sample size calculations for single binary endpoint
trials using five different methods.

\strong{Important:} This function is designed for a \strong{single binary endpoint}.
For co-primary endpoints, use \code{\link{ss2BinaryApprox}} (for approximate
methods) or \code{\link{ss2BinaryExact}} (for exact methods).

\strong{Notation:}
\itemize{
\item r = n1/n2: allocation ratio (group 1 to group 2)
\item κ = 1/r = n2/n1: inverse allocation ratio
\item π1, π2: response probabilities
\item θ1 = 1 - π1, θ2 = 1 - π2: non-response probabilities
\item δ = π1 - π2: treatment effect
}

\strong{AN (Asymptotic Normal) Method:}
Uses the standard normal approximation with pooled variance under H0:
\deqn{n_2 = \left\lceil \frac{(1 + \kappa)}{(\pi_1 - \pi_2)^2}
      \left(z_{1-\alpha} \sqrt{\bar{\pi}(1-\bar{\pi})} +
      z_{1-\beta} \sqrt{\kappa\pi_1\theta_1 + \pi_2\theta_2}\right)^2 / \kappa \right\rceil}
where \eqn{\bar{\pi} = (r\pi_1 + \pi_2)/(1 + r)} is the pooled proportion.

\strong{ANc Method:}
Adds continuity correction to the AN method. Uses iterative calculation because
the correction term depends on sample size. Converges when the difference between
successive iterations is ≤ 1.

\strong{AS (Arcsine) Method:}
Uses the variance-stabilizing arcsine transformation:
\deqn{n_2 = \left\lceil \frac{(z_{1-\alpha} + z_{1-\beta})^2}{4(\sin^{-1}\sqrt{\pi_1} - \sin^{-1}\sqrt{\pi_2})^2} \times \frac{1 + \kappa}{\kappa} \right\rceil}

\strong{ASc Method:}
Applies continuity correction to the arcsine method. Uses iterative procedure
with convergence criterion.

\strong{Fisher Method:}
Fisher's exact test does not have a closed-form sample size formula. This method:
\enumerate{
\item Starts with the AN method's sample size as initial value
\item Incrementally increases n2 by 1
\item Calculates exact power using hypergeometric distribution
\item Stops when power ≥ 1 - β
}

Note: Due to the saw-tooth nature of exact power (power does not increase
monotonically with sample size), linear extrapolation is inappropriate for
Fisher's method. The incremental approach ensures the minimum sample size
that achieves the target power.
