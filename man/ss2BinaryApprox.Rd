\value{

\item{p11, p12, p21, p22}{Response probabilities}

\item{r}{Allocation ratio}
\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level}

}
\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with two
co-primary binary endpoints using the linear extrapolation approach described
in Hamasaki et al. (2013).
}
\details{
This function uses the linear extrapolation approach to find the required
sample size iteratively:

\strong{Step 1:} Initialize with sample sizes from single endpoint formulas.
The initial values use the same testing method specified in the Test argument
to ensure consistency. Two initial values are calculated:
\itemize{
\item n2_0: Based on target power 1 - β
\item n2_1: Based on adjusted power 1 - √(1-β) to provide a bracket
}

\strong{Step 2-4:} Iteratively refine using linear extrapolation until convergence:
\deqn{n_2^{new} = \frac{n_2^{(0)}(power^{(1)} - (1-\beta)) - n_2^{(1)}(power^{(0)} - (1-\beta))}
      {power^{(1)} - power^{(0)}}}

The algorithm converges when \eqn{n_2^{(1)} = n_2^{(0)}}.

\strong{Note on Fisher's Exact Test:}
Fisher's exact test is not supported in this function because the saw-tooth
nature of exact power makes linear extrapolation inappropriate. For Fisher's
exact test with co-primary endpoints, use \code{\link{ss2BinaryExact}} instead,
or use this method for mixed endpoints via ss2Mixed (forthcoming).
