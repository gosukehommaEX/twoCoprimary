\value{

\item{t}{Follow-up time}
\item{mu0, mu1}{Means for continuous endpoint}
\item{sigma}{Standard deviation for continuous endpoint}

\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with one
overdispersed count co-primary endpoint and one continuous co-primary endpoint,
as described in Homma and Yoshida (2024).
}
\details{
This function uses linear extrapolation algorithm for efficient sample size
determination:

\strong{Step 1:} Initialize with sample sizes from single endpoint formulas

\strong{Step 2:} Set upper bound using adjusted power

\strong{Step 3-4:} Iteratively refine using linear extrapolation:
\deqn{n_0^{new} = \frac{n_0^{(0)}(power^{(1)} - (1-\beta)) - n_0^{(1)}(power^{(0)} - (1-\beta))}
      {power^{(1)} - power^{(0)}}}

The algorithm converges when \eqn{n_0^{(1)} = n_0^{(0)}}. If convergence is not
achieved within 100 iterations, a warning is issued.

The correlation bounds are automatically checked using \code{\link{corrbound2MixedContinuousCount}}.
If the specified correlation is outside the valid range, a warning is issued.

# Example 1: COPD trial scenario (Table 1 in Homma and Yoshida 2024)
# with nu = 0.8 and rho = 0.5

# Example 2: Multiple dispersion parameters

  r = 1, rho0 = 0.6, rho1 = 0.6,

# Example 3: Zero correlation (independent endpoints)
ssr2MixedContinuousCount(
  r0 = 1.5, r1 = 1.0, nu = 1.0, t = 1,
  mu0 = 0, mu1 = -40, sigma = 200,
  r = 1, rho0 = 0, rho1 = 0,
