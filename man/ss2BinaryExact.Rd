}
\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with two
co-primary binary endpoints using exact methods, as described in Homma and
Yoshida (2025).
}
\details{
This function uses a sequential search algorithm to find the minimum sample size
that achieves the target power:

\strong{Step 1:} Initialize with sample size from approximate method (AN).
This provides a good starting point for the exact calculation.

\strong{Step 2:} Use sequential search algorithm (Homma and Yoshida 2025, Algorithm 1):
\itemize{
\item Calculate power at initial sample size
\item If power >= target: decrease n2 until power < target, then add 1 back
\item If power < target: increase n2 until power >= target
}

\strong{Step 3:} Return final sample sizes.

Note: Due to the saw-tooth nature of exact power (power does not increase
monotonically with sample size), this sequential search ensures the minimum
sample size that achieves the target power.
