\item{alpha}{One-sided significance level}
\item{beta}{Type II error rate}

\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with two
co-primary binary endpoints using exact methods, as described in Homma and
Yoshida (2025).
}
\details{
This function implements the exact sample size calculation algorithm described
in Appendix C of Homma and Yoshida (2025):

\strong{Step 1:} Initialize with sample size from approximate method (AN)

\strong{Step 2:} Calculate exact power at current sample size

\strong{Step 3:} Adjust sample size:
\itemize{
\item If power >= 1 - beta: decrease n2 until power drops below target, then add 1
\item If power < 1 - beta: increase n2 until power reaches target
}

\strong{Step 4:} Return final sample size

The required sample size is calculated as equation (10):
\deqn{N_2 = \arg\min_{N_2 \in \mathbb{Z}} \{power_A(\theta) \geq 1 - \beta\}}
}
