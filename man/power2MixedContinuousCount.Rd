\description{
Calculates the power for a two-arm superiority trial with one overdispersed
count co-primary endpoint and one continuous co-primary endpoint, as described
in Homma and Yoshida (2024).
}
\details{
The test statistics are (equation 7 in Homma and Yoshida 2024):
\deqn{Z_1 = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{\sqrt{Var(\hat{\beta}_1)}}, \quad
      Z_2 = \frac{\hat{\delta}}{\sigma\sqrt{(1+\kappa)/(\kappa n_0)}}}

The joint distribution of (Z1, Z2) follows an asymptotic bivariate normal
distribution with correlation gamma (equation 11):
\deqn{\gamma = \sum_{j=0,1} \frac{n_0 \rho_j \sqrt{1+\lambda_j/\nu}}
      {n_j \sqrt{\lambda_j V_a} \sqrt{(1+\kappa)/\kappa}}}

where \eqn{\lambda_j = r_j \times t}.
