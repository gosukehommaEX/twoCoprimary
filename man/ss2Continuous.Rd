\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with two
co-primary continuous endpoints using linear extrapolation approach (for known
variance) or sequential search (for unknown variance).
}
\details{
This function uses different algorithms depending on the variance assumption:

\strong{For known variance (known_var = TRUE):}
Uses a linear extrapolation algorithm to efficiently determine the required sample size.

\strong{Step 1:} Initialize with sample sizes from single endpoint formulas.
Two initial values are calculated:
\itemize{
\item n2_0: Based on target power 1 - beta
\item n2_1: Based on adjusted power 1 - sqrt(1-beta) to provide a bracket
}

\strong{Step 2-4:} Iteratively refine using linear extrapolation until convergence:
\deqn{n_2^{new} = \frac{n_2^{(0)}(power^{(1)} - (1-\beta)) - n_2^{(1)}(power^{(0)} - (1-\beta))}
      {power^{(1)} - power^{(0)}}}

The algorithm converges when \eqn{n_2^{(1)} = n_2^{(0)}}.

\strong{For unknown variance (known_var = FALSE):}
Uses sequential search starting from initial sample size, incrementing by 1 until
target power is achieved. This approach is more stable for Monte Carlo simulation
where power estimates have random variation.

For known variance, the standardized test statistics are:
\deqn{Z_k = \frac{\delta_k}{\sigma_k \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}}}
For unknown variance, t-statistics with \eqn{\nu = n_1 + n_2 - 2} degrees of
freedom are used, and power is calculated using Monte Carlo simulation following
Sozu et al. (2011).
