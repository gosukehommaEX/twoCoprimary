\description{
Calculates the required sample size for a two-arm superiority trial with two
co-primary continuous endpoints using linear extrapolation approach (for known
variance) or sequential search (for unknown variance), as described in
Hamasaki et al. (2013) and Sozu et al. (2011).
}
\details{
This function uses different algorithms depending on the variance assumption:

\strong{For known variance (known_var = TRUE):}
Uses a linear extrapolation algorithm (Hamasaki et al. 2013) to efficiently
determine the required sample size.
\enumerate{
\item Initialize two sample sizes: \eqn{n_{2,0}} using target power \eqn{1-\beta}
and \eqn{n_{2,1}} using adjusted power \eqn{1-\sqrt{1-\beta}}
\item Calculate power at both sample sizes
\item Use linear extrapolation to estimate sample size achieving target power:
\deqn{n_{2,new} = \frac{n_{2,0}(power_{n_{2,1}} - (1-\beta)) - n_{2,1}(power_{n_{2,0}} - (1-\beta))}{power_{n_{2,1}} - power_{n_{2,0}}}}
\item Update values and repeat until convergence
}

\strong{For unknown variance (known_var = FALSE):}
Uses sequential search starting from initial sample size, incrementing by 1 until
target power is achieved. This approach is more stable for Monte Carlo simulation
where power estimates have random variation.

For known variance, the standardized test statistics are:
\deqn{Z_k = \frac{\delta_k}{\sigma_k \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}}}
For unknown variance, t-statistics with \eqn{\nu = n_1 + n_2 - 2} degrees of
freedom are used, and power is calculated using Monte Carlo simulation following
Sozu et al. (2011).
