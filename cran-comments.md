## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed URL redirect: Changed https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/twoCoprimary to 
  https://gosukehommaex.github.io/twoCoprimary/ (lowercase and trailing slash)
  
* Wrapped computationally intensive example in ss2BinaryExact() with \donttest{}
  to reduce check time

The spelling NOTEs for "Homma", "Sozu", "Yoshida", "et", and "al" are author 
names from published references and are spelled correctly.

## Test environments

* local Windows install, R 4.5.0
* GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest): R-devel, R-release, R-oldrel-1
